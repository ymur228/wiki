### What is Erupe?
Erupe is a server emulator for the game Monster Hunter Frontier(shut down in 2019), which was created purely for educational purposes.

### Why "Erupe"
Despite what some people think, this project is actually as a homage to famous Kenyan long-distance marathon runner, [Wilson Loyanae **Erupe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Loyanae_Erupe), _not_ based on the name of a creature in the game's universe. Definitely.
 
### How stable/functional is it?
This server has zero stability/functionality promises. It will crash, it has zero security measures, and it does not implement _many_ things.

### Installation
See the [Installation](Installation) wiki page for detailed installation instructions.

### Where do I get the client files and quest files?
No client or quest binaries for the game will be shared/linked from this project, without exception.
